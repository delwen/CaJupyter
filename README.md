## Analysis of action potential evoked dendritic calcium signals in the medial superior olive (MSO)

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook demonstrating the analysis of action potential evoked dendritic calcium signals during development in the MSO.

The code is linked to Figure 2 of the paper entitled *'Activity-dependent calcium signaling in neurons of the medial superior olive during late postnatal development'*, Journal of Neuroscience 16 January 2020, 1545-19; [https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1545-19.2020](https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1545-19.2020).

To run this Jupyter notebook, download the associated data archived in [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3614073) and extract it in the same folder as the Jupyter notebook. For details on the data, please consult the README.md in the Zenodo repository.

Integration with Binder is in progress!

The code used in this Jupyter notebook is the same as that used in the paper, with minor adaptations for the Jupyter notebook and Python 3. The original code is archived in Zenodo: [CaAnalysis: Analysis Toolbox for Ca²⁺ Imaging](https://zenodo.org/record/2575675#.Xi…).
